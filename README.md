# Plan Grid

This project is to demonstrate the grid view with a search option where the different posts can be searched. The landing page contains only 5 posts at the moment followed by the pagination. Pagination can be used to view more data, page by page. If there is no data the message, "No Data found" can be seen on that place.

## Project includes
`Grid View`
`Search the post functionality`
`Pagination to view more data, 5 at a time`
`Accessible and keyboard friendly`
`Some basic simple unit tests.`
